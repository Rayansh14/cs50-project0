This mini website that I created tells us about some current modes of transportation and their possible future alternatives. It considers the hyperloop as a replacement for planes, and evs as one for the fossil fuel powered vehicles that we see on the roads today. It also gives a side-by-side comparison of them. Here's what's there in each file:

1. index.html - This is the home page. It talks about transportation as a whole and also has a table: current vs future modes of transport.
2. planes.html - This page tells us about planes and a couple of interesting facts and stats about it. It features a comparison with hyperloop as well. It also has a list of the current biggest manufacturers of planes.
3. hyperloop.html
4. ice_cars.html
5. electric_cars.html
6. styles.css - This contains most of the styling for my html pages.
7. styles1.scss - This contains the scss styling, and includes an scss variable, an example of scss nesting, and an example of inheritance.
