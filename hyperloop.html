    <p class="col-11">A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and freight transportation, first used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint team from Tesla and SpaceX. Hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes with low air pressure through which a pod may travel substantially free of air resistance or friction.[2] The Hyperloop could convey people or objects at airline or hypersonic speeds while being very energy efficient.[2] This would drastically reduce travel times versus trains as well as planes.</p>
