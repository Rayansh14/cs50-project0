    <p class="col-11">Transport or transportation is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B. Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline and space. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations. In this website that I created for project 0, I am going to discuss some current modes of transport and their possible future alternatives.</p>
